# Badcamp

## Introduction

This is a codecool advanced project developed by 5 students (including me) to learn ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework 6 and React.js. The main concept was to create two separate applications, one Backend and one Frontend; and how they would communicate with each other in order to perform specific requests. The main focus was on building the Backend side.

## About

Badcamp is a web application for artists to share their songs and events. Users can search artists and songs and get information about recent events. The project is not finished completely, this far we could get in the last modul (around 4 weeks).

My task was to implement all the user related components, controllers and logic from scratch. Including the user/artist login, registration and complete authentication both on Backend and Frontend.

## Technical Highlights

- Clean Architectural design
- Separate Layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Frontend)
- Use cases for Application Business rules
- Mediator pattern
- DTOs for data transfer
- Database with Entity Framework
- Authentication with JSON Web Tokens

## Key Features

- Song and Artist listing with search box
- Login system with authentication
- Profile page for users
- Artist page for musicians
- Events page with voting for users
